ROADMAP:
- Allow monsters to move.  
      Ideas: 1. allow certain monsters to move only within a room
             2. make some monsters move randomly
             3. monsters have the co-ordinates of the player and attempt to go toward player trying to kill it.

- Create friendly characters. 
- Add Keys, a type of item.
