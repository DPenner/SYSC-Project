I was thinking some group notes could go here, like discussion or
extra comments on change (include name and date/time).

Everything should be ready now, I uploaded the good version of Zuul from the 
Objects first BlueJ book. Made two quickchanges so it can run well right away:
added a main method (there was none) and commented out an import that caused a compiler warning. 

Also, I put everything in a package called gameCore, but like we discussed, 
we might split the parsing stuff into a separate package
