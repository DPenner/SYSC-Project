I was thinking some group notes could go here, like discussion or
extra comments on change (include name and date/time).

Everything should be ready now, I uploaded the good version of Zuul from the Objects first BlueJ book. Made two quick changes so it can run well right away: added a main method (there was none) and commented out an import that caused a compiler warning. This gives a good starting point.
